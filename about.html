                    Hello! I’m Ahmed M. Elali, a passionate and driven Computer Science graduate from California State University, Fullerton, where I earned my Bachelor’s degree in December 2024. My academic background is rooted in courses like Data Structures & Algorithms, Software Engineering, Object-Oriented Programming, and Computer Architecture, which have equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of software development, systems design, and computational problem-solving.
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"></p>
                    Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have cultivated a deep enthusiasm for technology and innovation. I thrive on creating impactful, user-focused solutions and have hands-on experience across various domains, including mobile application development, web development, quality assurance, and user experience design. I’ve worked on projects that utilize cutting-edge technologies like augmented reality and have a keen interest in exploring intelligent systems and other emerging technologies.

                    Collaboration is at the heart of my work ethic. I enjoy working in dynamic team environments where ideas flow freely, and challenges are met with creativity and determination. My ability to adapt and learn quickly has allowed me to contribute meaningfully to diverse projects, from designing intuitive user interfaces to optimizing backend systems for performance and scalability.
